This text file explains the columns in 'CSaldanaPhD_Chapter4Data.csv', the supporting data file for Experiments 5, 6 and 7 in Chapter 4 'The effect of level-specific complexity in regularisation behaviour' of Carmen Saldana's doctoral thesis 'Simplifying linguistic complexity: Culture and cognition in language evolution' (2017). 

Descriptions of the column headings are as follows:

Experiment -- type of production task, isolate production ('ISO') or dyadic interaction ('DYAD')
Condition -- experimental condition ('Morphology', 'Word Order', 'NoL1 Word Order', 'Morphology Dyads' and 'Word Order Dyads')
DyadID -- the ID number of a Dyad (applicable to 'DYAD' only)
ParticipantID -- the ID number of each individual participant. In 'DYAD' experiments, ParticipantID is the same as the Dyad ID with an additional number at the end, either 1 or 2, that indicates each of the participants within the dyad.
Phase -- the experimental phase (analyses of output languages are run in 'testing_all' data)
Meaning -- the object displayed
InputSentence -- the description displayed along the object during training
RT -- reaction time (the time passed between initial display and button click)
MeaningSelection -- the object selected in the picture-selection tasks during training and/or matching trails during communication
OutputSentence -- description entered
CorrectedOutput -- proposed correction of output sentence to match input lexicon (corrected output was only used to replace identifiable typos)
Grammatical -- presence of the displayed description in the input language
GrammaticalityJudgment -- participants's judgment of whether the displayed description was present in the input language during training
Timestamp -- time of data collection
