This text file explains 'CSaldanaPhD_Chapter4Questionnaire.csv', the supporting data file for the post-experimental questionnaires discussed in Experiments 5, 6 and 7 in Chapter 4 'The effect of level-specific complexity in regularisation behaviour' of Carmen Saldana's doctoral thesis 'Simplifying linguistic complexity: Culture and cognition in language evolution' (2017). 

Descriptions of the column headings are as follows:

Experiment -- type of production task, isolate production ('ISO') or dyadic interaction ('DYAD')
Condition -- experimental condition ('Morphology', 'Word Order', 'NoL1 Word Order', 'Morphology Dyads' and 'Word Order Dyads')
ParticipantID -- the ID number of each individual participant
InputMajNumOnly -- participant's estimated input frequency for majority Num Only variant (actual input was 0.6)
InputMajTwoMod -- participant's estimated input frequency for majority Adj Only variant (actual input was 0.6)
InputMajTwoMod -- participant's estimated input frequency for majority two-modifier variant (actual input was 0.6)
OutputMajNumOnly -- participant's estimated output frequency (i.e. in production) for majority Num Only variant 
OutputMajTwoMod -- participant's estimated output frequency for majority Adj Only variant 
OutputMajTwoMod -- participant's estimated output frequency for majority two-modifier variant 
CommentsChoice -- participant's comments on the strategy they use to choose variants
LanguagesSpoken -- languages spoken by the participant
Timestamp -- time of data collection


NB Estimates for output proportions are not used in the analysis in Chapter 4; they were collected to check that participants do not introduce the same proportions for input and output estimated frequencies systematically.
